I am a hardworking and passionate technology enthusiast who loves understanding how something works, whether it be a new framework or my broken, old boiler at home. I am a quick learner and if it can't be learned quickly then I am happy to put in the time to do it the slow way. I have worked in Technology Consultancy for almost 8 years performing and managing early-stage design and development of products across the medical, consumer and defence industries. I have seen how digital technologies are impacting the way we interact with products and businesses today and I love that I can combine my creative and technical skills to quickly build something new.

I enjoy battling with mathematical problems so any role that can help satisfy that urge would be great. Whether it be manipulating large data sets, integrating analytical tools or looking into security and cryptography, I am eager to develop my capabilities. Above all I am looking for a job where I can continue to learn new technologies and concepts and keep pushing myself to be a better developer. Oh, and to have fun while I'm doing it!

## Skills

### Team Work and communication

The Makers course has helped me develop a number of keys skills such as:
* Pair programming
* Software development in small teams of 4-6 people
* Agile methodologies such as sprints and Kanban
* XP values

My career as a technology consultant has provided me with many opportunities to develop strong communication skills, including:
* Facilitating design workshops
* Delivering presentations to senior stakeholders
* Chairing weekly meetings with clients and suppliers

### Clean code advocate

I am a strong believer in the importance of writing clean and extendable code that is well tested.
I try to implement programming principles such as SOLID and DRY to ensure my codebase is as efficient and easy to understand as possible. I use TDD/BDD to improve the quality and robustness of my code and have seen their true value in speeding up the development process on more complex projects where edge cases and unexpected behaviour are harder to test manually.

### Technical Delivery

While working at PA Consulting I took on the role of Project Manager for the Technical Innovation Group (TIG) with Sir Ben Ainslie's Americas Cup sailing team. I was in charge of managing a portfolio of over 20 technical projects that delivered new capabilities to the team including new communications hardware, machine learning tools, and aerodynamic models. I was responsible for:
* Providing an interface between the team who were the business owners and the technical delivery teams
* Defining requirements
* Developing project scopes and plans
* Managing the day to day technical delivery and supplier relationships
* Tracking and reporting progress and financials

### Problem Solving

Problem solving is in my nature and is the main reason I was drawn to a career as an Engineer. I enjoy mathematical challenges and, in my previous job, often found myself drawn to projects that required an element of modelling. I created models ranging from the uptake of energy efficiency products in the home to the characteristics of a spring inside a medical device.

I have recently started a project to develop a tool that helps teachers group children based on their preferences. Although this is still very much in its infancy, I have enjoyed getting to grips with the underlying algorithms.

### Other Skills

- Qualified Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) Scrum Master
- Full product development lifecycle experience
- Data analysis using Excel, VBA, Tableau, Python with Pandas

## Interests

When I am not at my computer I like to keep active either with a game of Rugby at the weekend, a run around the local park or a bit of yoga. Occasionally I permit myself to get my guitar out and pretend I am not completely tone deaf. I love travelling and, when some free time opens up, I will eventually get around to learning Spanish.
